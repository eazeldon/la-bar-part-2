# La bar porject 

Graduate from Code Institute building this site to practice and grow my skills. The site is fictional.


### Concept

This project is a calling card app for the La Bar restaurant and bar.

### User story 

As a site owner, I want to showcase and market my business, so that potential visitors get an idea of what they can expect from a visit 
to my bar and restaurant.

As a potential visitor, I want to see pictures of the bar and the restaurant and information on what is offered, to
help me decide if I want to go.

As a sponsor of events, I want my events to be shown and remembered, so that future events will attract visitors. 

### Wireframe

I used balsamiq to design my wireframe. I used iPhone, iPad, and MacBook pro views to give myself an idea of what I wanted to achieve in terms 
of what the site visitors will see and how it should be displayed. I’m aware of that when implementing it will not be perfect on all screens and 
operating systems but rather it will be a compromise. My top priority is  Phone screens, followed by tablets and then laptop experience.

### UX Design

The design is intended to be straight forward, simple to navigate and understand, without any confusing elements 
that can distract the visitor from finding and using menu as well as finding the locations.

### Menu bar - top of page

Is in place to give easy access to the main pages of the site.

### About

About is a simple story of how the founders created this restaurant and bar.  

### Contact
